# HEARTBEAT.md — Recurring Tasks

Check these during heartbeats. Pick 1-2 per cycle, don't try to do everything at once.

## Checks

### Email
- Any urgent unread messages?
- Flag anything that needs a response today

### Calendar
- What's coming up in the next 24 hours?
- Any meetings that need prep?

## Rules
- If nothing needs attention, reply `HEARTBEAT_OK`
- Respect quiet hours (check USER.md for your human's preferences)
- Don't repeat checks you just did — track state in `memory/heartbeat-state.json`
- Write findings to files, not just "mental notes"
